`11.May at 13.43` - got an email of a potential internship opportunity at CGI
`11.May around 20.00` - Saw the email of a potential internship oppportunity and noticed a home task
15.May - 18.May - Had enough time to discuss with fellow students about the task, but not enough time to write any code
`18.May - 21.May at 13.00` - Cloned the repo and started learning and figuring out about AngularJS, also tried a CodeCademy course (usually really useful), but environments were too different and as the codeCademy course did not use classes and also did not have bunch of other external stuff added (scss, material etc), then it quickly grew over the head for me to keep learning so much at once. I got far enough to understand most of the frontend code/logic, but almost all my tries to implement something myself in AngularJS failed. I decided to pivot to ReactJS as I am quite familiar and comfortable with it
`21.May since 13.00 - 16.00` - Created a separate directory 'react-frontend' and set up a new react app inside it, using command `npx create-react-app react-frontend`, I also set the port to `4200` just in case the backend's CORS allows access via checking the port number. With react it took me only 3 hours to get the frontend to similar place of the AngularJS version (routing, fetching book list, fetching individual books, etc), even added a pagination component on the library-view for future pagination support (Almost no design, yet) (Started documenting + first push of react app).
